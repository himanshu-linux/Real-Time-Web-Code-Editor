# Real-Time-Web-Code-Editor
 This project delves into the exciting realm of real-time web development. We'll be building an interactive code editor, empowering users to write and visualize HTML code with instant feedback. Imagine a platform where every keystroke translates into a dynamic update on the screen â€“ that's the magic we're aiming to create! The project will embark on a journey, starting with a solid foundation of HTML structure and a visually appealing CSS layer. As development progresses, we can delve into more sophisticated techniques, potentially incorporating libraries like CodeMirror. This will unlock features like syntax highlighting, further enhancing the user experience.
